This is a source engine variant forked from Mapbase 6.3 (https://archive.org/details/Mapbase63) (https://github.com/mapbase-source/source-sdk-2013),
and thus shares all of it's credits, as listed in that project readme file. 

Features:
MP3 player is enabled by default.
New cat themed commands.

Issues: 
error relating to 'sdk_cable' 1= null in c_rope.cpp that can crash the game, currently bodged having it find 'cable' instead, but cables themselves
still seem be be broken.

Map related issue in a1_klepto_1 and diverivities when players use the gravity gun on the beta bus.
